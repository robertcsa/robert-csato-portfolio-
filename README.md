The portfolio combines:

- Enterprise-scale logistics and systems engineering (Germany, USA, Hungary)
- Business informatics and empirical research (FAU Erlangen–Nuremberg)
- Usability & software acceptance (pre-UX era), Open Source adoption
- Early computing and a deep technical culture (8-bit era, behind the Iron Curtain)
- AI- and system-design mindset aligned with xAI’s mission

## How this relates to xAI and Lead Grok Engineering

The xAI Lead Grok Engineer role requires:

- End-to-end problem solving and system ownership  
- Ability to understand user pain points and build robust technical solutions  
- Comfort with ambiguity, complex architectures, and high-impact environments  
- Strong communication skills and customer-facing engineering capability

Over the past decades I have:

- Designed and implemented a full-stack operational system for Dräger Medical
- Architected a SAP-based production logistics concept for Odenwald-Früchte
- Optimised retail networks and warehouse restarts for PLUS (Germany)
- Managed day-to-day retail logistics for Coop in Hungary
- Conducted empirical research on software acceptance and Open Source at scale
- Developed deep intuition for usability, trust, and system adoption

This portfolio makes that trajectory transparent and verifiable.
