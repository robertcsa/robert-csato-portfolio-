# Executive Summary – COOP Retail Operations & Logistics

My work at COOP / Plus Élelmiszerdiszkont provided hands-on operational leadership in a fast-paced retail environment. I managed store logistics, personnel scheduling, inventory control, backroom organisation, and daily warehouse–store replenishment workflows. I optimised receiving, stocking, shift planning, and cold-chain handling while resolving operational bottlenecks such as congestion, shrinkage, equipment failures, and peak-hour instability. This role formed the operational foundation of my later logistics and ERP systems expertise by giving me direct, real-world understanding of supply chain flow, human-system interaction, and resource-constrained optimisation. It established my ability to stabilise and improve complex operational systems with measurable results.


# 100-Words Exceptional Work Statement (xAI Application)

I improved the daily operations of COOP retail stores by optimising logistics, staffing, and inventory flows under real-world constraints. I coordinated warehouse deliveries, managed backroom organisation, ensured FIFO/FEFO processes, reduced shrinkage, and resolved operational bottlenecks such as cold-chain issues and peak-hour congestion. I supervised staff, redesigned shift structures, and implemented more efficient unloading and shelf-stocking procedures. These improvements stabilised store performance, increased on-shelf availability, and reduced operational waste. This experience laid the groundwork for my later work in large-scale logistics systems by teaching me how to diagnose bottlenecks, design workflows, and deliver measurable improvements under pressure.

# COOP Retail Operations & Logistics  
### Store-Level Logistics, Personnel Management, and Operational Optimisation  
### Author: Robert Csató

## Overview
This repository documents my operational and logistics experience at COOP / Plus Élelmiszerdiszkont in Hungary. The work involved managing daily store operations, coordinating deliveries, optimising staff schedules, handling inventory flows, and ensuring compliance with food safety and cold-chain requirements.

## Key Responsibilities
- Shift and personnel management  
- Delivery reception and backroom organisation  
- FIFO/FEFO stock rotation  
- Shelf-stocking optimisation  
- Shrinkage prevention and loss control  
- Operational troubleshooting (equipment failures, cold-chain issues)  

## Logistics Architecture
The work required real-time coordination between:
- regional distribution centres  
- delivery drivers  
- store teams  
- category and merchandising managers  

## Impact
- Improved on-shelf availability  
- Reduced shrinkage  
- Faster unloading and restocking processes  
- More stable store operations under peak demand  

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` → detailed descriptions of each operational domain  
- `diagrams/` → ASCII architecture and workflow diagrams  
- `analysis/` → operational bottleneck evaluations  
- `legacy/` → background material  

## Relevance
This project highlights strong system thinking, human–system interaction insight, real-time problem solving, and optimisation skills that later enabled enterprise-grade logistics design, ERP preparation, and complex system architecture work.
