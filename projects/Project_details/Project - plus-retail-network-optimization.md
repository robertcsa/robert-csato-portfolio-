# 1) Executive Summary – Plus Retail Network Optimization

I conducted a large-scale logistics optimisation project for Plus Warenhandelsgesellschaft mbH in Germany, analysing ~430 retail stores and performing on-site assessments at more than 350 locations. I evaluated buffer capacity, receiving infrastructure, storage constraints, route efficiency, delivery frequency, and seasonal demand patterns. I optimised the hub-and-spoke distribution network, redesigned route clustering, improved delivery timing, and supported the operational restart of the Kempten regional warehouse after a major shutdown. The work produced measurable improvements in supply chain stability, delivery performance, and inventory availability, demonstrating strong system-level analytical skills under real operational pressure.


# 2) 100-Words Exceptional Work Statement (xAI Application)

I optimised the nationwide retail distribution network of Plus Warenhandelsgesellschaft by analysing approximately 430 stores and performing field assessments at more than 350 locations. I evaluated storage capacity, delivery timing, route efficiency, seasonal demand patterns, and warehouse–store synchronisation. I redesigned route clusters, improved replenishment frequency, and supported the restart of the Kempten regional warehouse following a major operational disruption. These changes improved delivery reliability, inventory availability, and system stability. This project demonstrates my ability to analyse complex logistics systems in real environments, translate field data into structured optimisation strategies, and implement solutions that deliver measurable operational improvements.

# Plus Retail Network Optimization  
### Field-Based Logistics Analysis, Route Engineering & Warehouse Restart Leadership  
### Author: Robert Csató

## Overview
This repository documents the nationwide logistics optimisation work performed for Plus Warenhandelsgesellschaft mbH. The project involved analysing over 430 retail stores, performing field visits to ~350 locations, evaluating route structures, redesigning cluster cycles, and supporting the operational restart of the Kempten distribution centre.

## Key Components
- Field-based store analysis  
- Hub-and-spoke evaluation  
- Route clustering and optimisation  
- Delivery frequency redesign  
- Warehouse restart coordination  
- Seasonal and regional demand modelling  

## Impact
The project improved:
- delivery punctuality  
- inventory availability  
- warehouse throughput  
- route efficiency  
- operational stability  

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` → comprehensive documentation  
- `diagrams/` → ASCII diagrams of flows and networks  
- `analysis/` → operational and statistical evaluations  
- `legacy/` → background and historic context  

## Relevance
This project demonstrates strong system-level thinking, real-world optimisation skills, and the ability to stabilise complex operational networks under pressure—essential capabilities for designing and evaluating AI-powered systems.
