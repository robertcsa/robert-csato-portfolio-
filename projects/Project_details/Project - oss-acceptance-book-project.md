# 1) Executive Summary – OSS Acceptance Book Project

My published work, *“Akzeptanz von Open Source Software – Eine empirische Untersuchung über die Akzeptanz auf dem Arbeitsplatzrechner”* (ISBN 978-3639000818), presents a complete behavioural, empirical, and organisational analysis of how employees adopt or resist Open Source Software in workplace environments. The project combined TAM and DOI acceptance models, software usability research, organisational psychology, and full SPSS statistical evaluation. By identifying the key drivers of acceptance—perceived usefulness, ease of use, trust, stability, and organisational support—the book delivered a rigorous, data-backed model for predicting software adoption. The research anticipated modern AI adoption challenges and provides deep insight into human–technology interaction and system rollout dynamics.


# 2) 100-Words Exceptional Work Statement (xAI Application)

I conducted an empirical, SPSS-based research project analysing how employees adopt Open Source Software in enterprise environments. Using TAM, DOI, usability, and organisational behaviour models, I identified the key drivers of software acceptance, including usefulness, ease of use, trust, stability, and training. I designed the full study, built the evaluation instruments, analysed statistical relationships, validated hypotheses, and published the results as a book with ISBN registration. This work demonstrates my ability to measure user behaviour, build evaluation frameworks, analyse complex datasets, and understand the human factors that shape technology adoption—directly relevant to model evals and AI system deployment.

# OSS Acceptance Book Project  
### Empirical Research on Software Adoption, Behavioural Modelling, and Organisational Informatics  
### Author: Robert Csató  
### ISBN: 978-3639000818

## Overview
This repository documents the research, methodology, analysis, and theoretical foundation behind my published book *“Akzeptanz von Open Source Software – Eine empirische Untersuchung über die Akzeptanz auf dem Arbeitsplatzrechner.”*

The work explores how employees accept or resist Open Source Software (OSS) in enterprise settings, using behavioural models such as TAM and DOI, combined with usability research and organisational psychology.

## Key Components
- Full empirical SPSS-based analysis  
- Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)  
- Diffusion of Innovations (DOI)  
- Usability and human–computer interaction  
- Organisational support & trust factors  
- Statistical validation of acceptance drivers  
- Published research outputs  

## Why It Matters
The findings offer insights highly relevant to modern AI adoption, including:
- user trust and expectation modelling  
- behavioural evaluation frameworks  
- training and organisational rollout design  
- human–machine interaction psychology  
- system acceptance under uncertainty  

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` → Full research documentation  
- `diagrams/` → Acceptance model diagrams  
- `data/` → Variables, hypotheses, SPSS syntax  
- `legacy/` → Publication details and historical notes  

## Relevance for AI Engineering
This project demonstrates strong analytical skills, behavioural modelling capability, and deep understanding of human–technology interaction—directly applicable to LLM evals, AI adoption, system UX design, and customer-facing engineering work.
