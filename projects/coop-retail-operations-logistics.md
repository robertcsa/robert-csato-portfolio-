## 1. Overview

This document summarises my contributions to COOP / Plus Élelmiszerdiszkont retail operations in Hungary, covering:

- store-level operations management  
- logistics coordination  
- personnel scheduling and leadership  
- warehouse–store replenishment optimisation  
- retail merchandising and product flow  
- loss-prevention measures  
- daily operational troubleshooting  

This experience forms a critical early foundation of my understanding of physical retail systems—knowledge that later evolved into high-level supply chain design, ERP preparation, and large-scale system engineering skills.
