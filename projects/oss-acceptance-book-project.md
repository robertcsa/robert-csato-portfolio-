## 1. Overview

This appendix summarises the full academic and empirical foundation of my published book:

**“Akzeptanz von Open Source Software – Eine empirische Untersuchung über die Akzeptanz auf dem Arbeitsplatzrechner.”**

The work investigates the psychological, organisational, and technological factors influencing the acceptance of **Open Source Software (OSS)** in the workplace.  

It represents a comprehensive blend of:

- behavioural science  
- IT system evaluation  
- UX and usability analysis  
- empirical SPSS-based research  
- organisational informatics  
- early enterprise software adoption modelling  

The project anticipated many of the core challenges seen today in **AI adoption**, **LLM-driven workflows**, and **AI–human interaction design**.

## 2. Motivation for the Book

At the time of the research, Open Source Software was transitioning from niche use into enterprise settings.  
Organisations were beginning to consider replacing proprietary systems with OSS-based solutions such as:

- Linux distributions  
- OpenOffice / StarOffice  
- Firefox / Mozilla Suite  
- early open-source network and security tools  

Key questions included:

- How do employees react to OSS in professional environments?  
- What psychological and usability barriers exist?  
- How can organisations support a successful transition?  
- What role does perceived usefulness play?  
- What are the risks of introducing OSS without training or communication?  

These questions mirror modern AI acceptance challenges.

## 3. Theoretical Foundations Used in the Book

### **3.1. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**
Core components:
- Perceived Usefulness  
- Perceived Ease of Use  
- Behavioural Intention  
- Actual Use  

Applied to measure:
- willingness to adopt OSS tools  
- correlation between ease-of-use and usefulness  
- perceived risk and complexity  

### **3.2. Diffusion of Innovations (DOI)**
From Everett Rogers:
- innovators  
- early adopters  
- early majority  
- late majority  
- laggards  

Applied to understand:
- user segments inside companies  
- resistance profiles  
- internal organisational champions  

### **3.3. Software Usability & HCI**
Measured through:
- interface learning curve  
- error tolerance  
- task completion time  
- cognitive load  
- workflow friction  

### **3.4. Organisational Behaviour Models**
Included:
- trust in IT management  
- support systems  
- training influence  
- supervisor attitudes  
- informal power structures

## 4. Empirical Research Methodology

The book includes a complete empirical research pipeline:

### **4.1. Survey Design**
- Likert scales  
- structured questionnaires  
- demographic segmentation  

### **4.2. SPSS Analysis**
Performed:
- descriptive statistics  
- factor analysis  
- regression models  
- Cronbach’s alpha reliability  
- significance testing  
- correlation matrices  

### **4.3. Hypotheses Tested**
Examples:
- H1: Perceived ease of use correlates positively with perceived usefulness.  
- H2: Users with higher IT self-efficacy show higher acceptance.  
- H3: Organisational support reduces perceived complexity.  
- H4: Prior experience with OSS increases behavioural intention.  

All results were statistically evaluated.

## 5. Key Findings From the Book

### **5.1. Ease of Use → Usefulness**
Strong positive correlation.

### **5.2. Trust & Stability Critical for Adoption**
Users resist tools that feel “unstable” or “unpredictable.”

### **5.3. Training & Support Essential**
Organisations underestimate the value of internal education.

### **5.4. Cultural Resistance Stronger Than Technical Resistance**
Even excellent software fails without social acceptance.

### **5.5. OSS Is Not Adopted Purely on Merit**
Employees need:
- familiarity  
- reassurance  
- transparency  
- compatibility with existing workflows  

These insights are directly transferable to modern AI systems.

## 6. Organisational Insights

### **6.1. Hidden Influencers Matter**
“Unofficial experts” inside organisations strongly influence acceptance.

### **6.2. Communication Is More Important Than Technology**
Uncertainty increases resistance.

### **6.3. Gradual Rollout Works Better**
Pilot → training → phased adoption.

### **6.4. Mixed Environments Require Clear Rules**
OSS and proprietary systems can coexist successfully with proper standardisation.

## 7. Relevance to AI Adoption and the xAI Role

The book’s insights are directly applicable to:

### **7.1. AI Adoption Modelling**
User trust, expectations, and perceived usefulness are central to LLM success.

### **7.2. Prompt Engineering & Usability**
Ease of interaction = higher perceived usefulness.

### **7.3. Evals and Behavioural Testing**
Designing evals requires:
- hypothesis formulation  
- measurable constructs  
- statistical interpretation  

Exactly the skills the book project developed.

### **7.4. Human-in-the-Loop Systems**
The book provides early insights into how people respond to new digital tools.

### **7.5. Organisational Transformation**
AI introduction mirrors OSS introduction:
- requires support  
- communication  
- perceived stability  

Your book directly prepares you for customer-facing AI system guidance.

## 9. Project Impact

The book project:

- validated OSS acceptance factors in a workplace environment  
- provided an empirical, statistically verified model  
- delivered actionable organisational recommendations  
- was published internationally with ISBN registration  
- positioned you early in your career as a researcher in  
  **software psychology, user acceptance, organisational informatics, and socio-technical systems**  

This represents a unique intersection of research, engineering thinking, and behavioural understanding.
