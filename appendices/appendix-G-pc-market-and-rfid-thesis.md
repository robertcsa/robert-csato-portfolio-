# Appendix G – Early PC Market Analysis & RFID/Barcode Thesis Work

This appendix summarises two major research works completed during my Hungarian academic period (1996–2000), both of which contributed significantly to my later competence in logistics systems, technology adoption, industrial informatics, and real-world workflow modelling.

The first project analysed the evolution of the PC market in Hungary during a period of rapid technological and economic transition.  
The second project involved a full-scale study of barcode- and RFID-based inventory and production logistics at the Trilak–Haering paint manufacturing company.

Both projects provided foundational knowledge that later supported my SAP logistics design work, empirical research at FAU, and enterprise system engineering roles.

## 1. PC Market Evolution in Hungary (1996–2000)

### 1.1. Context
During the late 1990s, Hungary was transitioning from:
- a centrally planned economy to a market economy,  
- an analogue infrastructure to an emerging digital one,  
- early PC adoption to mass computerisation.

Computers were becoming accessible to:
- businesses,  
- educational institutions,  
- and households.

This shift created a unique landscape for technological diffusion.

### 1.2. Research Focus
My market analysis examined:
- PC hardware evolution (386 → Pentium II era)  
- operating system penetration (DOS, Windows 3.x, 95, 98)  
- price elasticity and demand curves  
- consumer segmentation  
- retail channel structures  
- import dynamics and distribution bottlenecks  
- competitor analysis (Western vs. local vendors)  
- brand perception and trust factors in emerging markets

### 1.3. Methods Used
- questionnaire-based market surveys  
- structured interviews with retailers and distributors  
- comparative price analysis  
- supply chain mapping  
- store-channel observation  
- early concepts resembling modern UX research (e.g., user frustrations, installation experiences, usability patterns)

### 1.4. Key Insights
- Consumer decision-making was influenced primarily by **trust, simplicity, and availability**, not by technical specifications.  
- Price/performance ratios and foreign brands heavily shaped adoption curves.  
- Distribution networks were still inefficient and required modern logistics practices.  
- Lack of support and education slowed down technological uptake.  
- Early technical shops functioned as both retailers and informal support centres.

### 1.5. Long-Term Impact on My Work
This study helped me understand:
- how technology spreads among real users,  
- how trust and perceived usefulness shape adoption,  
- and how logistics affects technological availability.

These insights directly fed into my later:
- SPSS acceptance research at FAU,  
- software adoption models,  
- and enterprise systems design competencies.

## 2. RFID & Barcode-Based Inventory Systems  
### (Thesis at Trilak–Haering Paint Manufacturing)

### 2.1. Industrial Context
Trilak–Haering was a major chemical-industry manufacturer specialising in:
- paints,  
- coatings,  
- solvents,  
- industrial colour-mixtures.

The company required high-precision tracking due to:
- chemical safety regulations,  
- batch and lot integrity,  
- raw-material control,  
- compliance obligations.

### 2.2. Objective of the Thesis
To map, analyse, and propose improvements to:
- barcode-based tracking systems,  
- warehouse workflows,  
- production flows,  
- packaging lines,  
- and early RFID-adoption feasibility.

### 2.3. Research Scope
My study included:
- mapping raw material inputs  
- tracking semi-finished goods  
- modelling production-line flow  
- analysing warehouse layouts  
- evaluating forklift-based movement patterns  
- assessing error rates in manual processes  
- evaluating labelling methods  
- exploring RFID for future automation

### 2.4. Methods & Tools
- industrial-process observation  
- interviews with production managers  
- plant-floor tracking simulations  
- barcode scanning workflow analysis  
- early digital mapping of material flows  
- KPI evaluation (lead time, throughput, error reduction potential)  
- compliance mapping for chemical industry regulations

### 2.5. Key Findings
- Barcode systems were functional but fragmented  
- Data quality issues emerged from manual relabelling  
- Production and packaging flows were insufficiently synchronised  
- Buffer-zone planning was suboptimal  
- RFID showed high potential for:
  - automated route decisions  
  - quality tracing  
  - batch-level tracking  
  - real-time warehouse visibility  

### 2.6. Proposed Improvements
- unified barcode labelling standards  
- integrated warehouse–production system models  
- RFID adoption plan with cost–benefit projections  
- centralised digital tracking system  
- reorganised buffer and staging areas  
- improved material-handling logic

These recommendations anticipated modern industrial informatics principles.

- empirical observation techniques  

### Analytical & Research Skills
- structured interviewing  
- market and competitor analysis  
- KPI formulation  
- user-behaviour interpretation  
- early UX reasoning

## 4. Relevance to Modern AI & Systems Engineering

The combined effect of these early thesis works directly strengthens:

### 4.1. Model Evaluation
Understanding user behaviour, error patterns, and adoption barriers translates to:
- better prompt evaluation  
- improved model-behaviour diagnostics  
- more effective AI usability improvements  

### 4.2. Workflow Engineering
Process-mapping skills support:
- designing AI-enabled logistics solutions  
- building end-to-end workflows  
- scoping enterprise integration projects  

### 4.3. Safety & Traceability  
Chemical-industry batch tracking parallels:
- AI audit trails  
- model-versioning  
- dataset lineage  
- compliance-aligned system documentation  

### 4.4. AI Deployment in Real Environments
These theses strengthened:
- practical constraint awareness  
- understanding of human limitations  
- appreciation for robustness and clarity  
- early experience in system–user alignment

## 5. Summary

This appendix documents:

1. The analytical study of Hungary’s PC market during a key period of digital transformation.  
2. A full-scale industrial thesis on RFID/barcode-based logistics at a chemical manufacturing company.  
3. The empirical, technical, and behavioural foundations gained from both works.  
4. How these foundations continue to influence my approach to AI, systems design, and engineering leadership.

Together, these projects formed the earliest but highly influential basis of my later work in logistics, business informatics, empirical modelling, and complex system design.
