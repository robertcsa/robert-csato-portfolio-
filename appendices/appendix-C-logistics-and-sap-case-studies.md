# Appendix C – Logistics and SAP Case Studies

This appendix documents the key logistics, distribution, warehouse, and SAP-integrated system designs I contributed to across Germany, Hungary, and the USA. These projects represent a consistent ability to analyse complex supply chains, design robust operational processes, and implement data-driven, scalable systems — experience directly relevant for high-impact system engineering roles such as Lead Grok Engineer at xAI.

## 1. Dräger Medical Systems Inc. (USA)  
### **Full-Stack Operational System for Demonstration Equipment**

**Location:** Danvers, MA  
**Scope:** North American demo-device logistics  
**Core Problem:** Managing a multi-million-dollar fleet of medical demonstration equipment across the U.S. and Canada with fragmented workflows and no unified data system.

### **My Contribution**
- Designed and implemented a complete Access-based full-stack operational system.  
- Integrated the following functional modules:
  - Inventory tracking  
  - Routing and shipment control  
  - User assignment logic  
  - Maintenance scheduling  
  - Device life-cycle reporting  
  - Automated printouts & documentation  
- Unified logistics, sales, and service workflows into a single coherent platform.  
- Ensured traceability and transparency of all demo devices.

### **Impact**
- Replaced manual processes with a structured, data-driven architecture.  
- Greatly reduced errors and increased equipment utilisation.  
- System remained in use for more than a year after my departure.  
- Served as a conceptual basis for later internal Dräger tools.

## 2. Odenwald-Früchte GmbH (Andros Deutschland)  
### **SAP-Integrated Production Logistics and Disposal Architecture**

**Scope:** Factory-level logistics, production flow, waste-flow integration  
**Industry:** Food production (fruit processing, purées, juices, baby foods)

### **System Concept**
Developed a complete **SAP-integrated logistics and production flow architecture**, including:

- Material flows (input → processing → output)  
- Waste and by-product flows (disposal and recycling logic)  
- Storage and buffer capacities  
- Production scheduling dependencies  
- Integration points for SAP modules (MM / PP / WM)  
- Packaging-logistics interactions  
- Data structures for traceability (Lot, Batch, Charge)  

### **My Contribution**
- Mapped the entire production- and disposal-chain into a unified process model.  
- Designed interface concepts for SAP integration.  
- Modelled inventory states, production triggers, and workflow transitions.  
- Created a resource-optimised logistics blueprint.

### **Outcome**
The project was prepared for implementation but cancelled due to a missing €20,000 from a €120,000 budget.  
Nevertheless:
- The architecture proved fully viable.  
- Demonstrated my capacity to design enterprise-grade SAP logistics systems.  
- Showed deep understanding of industrial production constraints.

## 3. PLUS Warenhandelsgesellschaft mbH (Germany)  
### **Retail Distribution Network Analysis & Warehouse Restart**

**Location:** Mülheim a.d. Ruhr (HQ) + NRW store network  
**Scope:** ~430 retail stores, HUB-and-spoke distribution

### **Key Tasks**
- Conducted a full network analysis during a period of organisational transition.  
- Visited ~350+ stores to assess:
  - Retail storage conditions  
  - Shelf and backroom capacity  
  - Buffer zones  
  - Delivery rhythm and constraints  
  - Inventory turnover  
- Analysed warehouse bottlenecks after a union-related stoppage.  
- Supported the restart of central warehouse operations.  
- Modelled ideal routing and delivery frequency scenarios.

### **Deliverables**
- Store-by-store logistics assessments  
- Network-wide optimisation proposals  
- Warehouse restart coordination plan  
- Real-world stabilisation of supply chain flows under crisis conditions

### **Impact**
- Improved replenishment efficiency  
- Increased warehouse resilience  
- Provided critical real-time operational insights  
- Built strong practical foundations in retail logistics

## 4. Coop / Food Discount Operations (Hungary)  
### **Store-Level Logistics, Procurement, and Personnel Management**

**Scope:** Daily supply chain operations for food retail  
**Key Responsibilities:**
- Store-level inventory control  
- Routing and replenishment  
- Warehouse coordination  
- Supplier delivery management  
- Staff scheduling and operational leadership  
- Real-time problem-solving under consumer constraints

### **Impact**
Hands-on operational discipline that complements system-level engineering knowledge:  
- Understanding of real operational bottlenecks  
- Predicting store-level behaviour  
- Navigating perishable-food constraints  
- Direct exposure to customer-facing realities  
These insights strongly influenced my ability to build user-aligned systems.

## 5. Trilak–Haering Paint Manufacturing (Hungary)  
### **RFID- & Barcode-Based Inventory and Logistics Systems**

**Industry:** Chemical manufacturing (paint & coatings)  
**Scope:** Production, warehousing, and distribution flows

### **Thesis Work**
Developed a detailed analysis and optimisation plan for:
- Barcode-based tracking  
- RFID pre-adoption concepts  
- Warehouse flows  
- Raw-material and finished-goods movement  
- Chemical-industry regulatory constraints  
- Batch/lot tracking  
- Quality integration in logistics flows

This experience provided early foundations in:
- Industrial informatics  
- Warehouse-control logic  
- Automation potential in production logistics  
- Traceability modelling

## 6. BayWa / Fraunhofer-Linked Projects (Germany)  
### **Balanced Scorecard & Early Parcel Automat Concepts**

**Scope:** Retail and distribution modernisation (state-supported project)

### **Key Elements**
- Balanced Scorecard frameworks for logistics decision-making  
- KPI frameworks linking:
  - Shelf availability  
  - Delivery reliability  
  - Cost per route  
  - Buffer and safety-stock metrics  
- Analysis of early “pickup box” automation systems  
  (essentially precursors to Packstation, A-Box, Z-Box)  
- Identification of efficiency potentials in retail-store networks  
- Simulation-based evaluation of alternative distribution strategies

### **Outcome**
Strengthened:
- Structural modelling skills  
- System metrics thinking  
- Interdisciplinary communication (industry + tech + government)

## 8. Relevance for AI / xAI System Engineering

These case studies illustrate direct parallels with the responsibilities of a Lead Grok Engineer:
- Translating real-world constraints into functional system architectures  
- Working with customers to identify bottlenecks and needs  
- Designing scalable, maintainable workflows  
- Integrating human behaviour and technology  
- Delivering solutions under ambiguity  
- Communicating across technical and business stakeholders  

This logistics–SAP background provides a rare real-world foundation for designing AI-driven tools that must align with complex operational environments.
