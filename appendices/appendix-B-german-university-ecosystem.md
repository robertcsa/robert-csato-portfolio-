# Appendix B – German University Ecosystem for Business Informatics, Logistics, and AI

This appendix summarises the German academic ecosystem relevant to my education, focusing on Wirtschaftsinformatik, Logistics, Strategic Management, empirical methods, and AI-related systems engineering. It outlines the historical FAU environment, the key professors and chairs, Fraunhofer integration, and modern TU-level programs where similar subjects are taught today.

## 1. Historical Context (1998–2006)

During my studies at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen–Nürnberg (FAU), the university was a national leader in:
- Business Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik)
- Logistics and Supply Chain Management
- Strategic and Corporate Management
- Empirical Research (SPSS-driven)
- Early software evolution and usability analysis

The regional ecosystem included:
- Fraunhofer Institutes (IIS – Integrated Circuits)
- BayWa innovation projects
- Early mobile-application research cooperations (e.g., Nokia)
- Retail and logistics networks in Bavaria and NRW

This environment produced a strong blend of academic depth and applied industrial research.
