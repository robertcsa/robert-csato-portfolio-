## Professional Profile

AI-driven systems engineer and logistics/software integration expert with a rare combination of enterprise-scale operations experience, applied machine intelligence thinking, empirical research, usability/acceptance engineering, and early computing roots.

I have built complex operational systems in Germany and the USA, designed a full SAP-integrated logistics architecture, created large-scale enterprise databases, and led multi-site supply chain optimisation projects. I turn real-world business problems into working technical systems – exactly the core requirement for a Lead Grok Engineer at xAI.

Key strengths:

- Full-stack system thinking from 8-bit computing to enterprise SAP
- Software acceptance, UX-before-UX, and human–machine alignment
- Strong empirical foundation (SPSS, TAM, DOI models)
- Enterprise architecture under tight constraints
- Ability to lead pods, scope systems, identify user pain points, design solutions, automate processes, and communicate clearly.

---

## Core Technical Competencies

- AI & LLM-oriented system design and prompt engineering  
- Python and data modelling (SQL, Access-based full-stack systems)  
- Empirical analytics: SPSS, survey design, statistical modelling  
- Human–machine interaction, usability and software acceptance  
- Enterprise architecture: SAP logistics concepts, integration logic  
- Warehouse management, HUB-and-spoke networks, intralogistics  
- RFID/barcode systems, production flow modelling  
- HTTP / API workflows, modern software design patterns

## Professional Experience (Selected)

### Dräger Medical Systems Inc. – Danvers, MA, USA  
**Full-stack operational system for high-value demo equipment**

- Designed and implemented an end-to-end logistics and equipment-management platform for a multi-million-dollar fleet of medical demonstration devices across North America.  
- Combined warehouse control, shipping automation, inventory logic, and reporting into a single coherent system.  
- Replaced fragmented, manual workflows with a data-driven architecture that supported sales, service and logistics simultaneously.  
- The system remained in production more than a year after my departure and served as a conceptual basis for later internal tools.

**Impact:** Demonstrated end-to-end systems ownership, data modelling, and robust architecture – directly relevant to building LLM-powered, production-ready tools for customers.

---

### Odenwald-Früchte GmbH (Andros Deutschland) – Germany  
**SAP-integrated production logistics architecture**

- Designed a complete SAP-based production logistics and disposal-integration concept.  
- Modelled material flows, waste streams, routing structures, and process interfaces.  
- Aligned logistics, production and quality flows into a unified system design.  
- The project was fully prepared conceptually but cancelled due to a missing €20,000 in a €120,000 budget; the design still proved my ability to architect enterprise-level systems.

**Impact:** Enterprise SAP and logistics system design experience, highly valuable for designing complex, stateful AI-driven systems and integrations.

### PLUS Warenhandelsgesellschaft mbH – Mülheim a.d. Ruhr, Germany  
**Central HQ logistics and network optimisation**

- Participated in central logistics planning during a period of structural change.  
- Conducted a large-scale field study: visited ~350 stores (of ~430) to analyse storage infrastructure, buffer zones, replenishment cycles, and delivery constraints.  
- Contributed to restarting warehouse operations after a union-related disruption, supporting the reactivation of supply flows.  
- Learned and practiced HUB-and-spoke distribution concepts, routing optimisation, and store-network analysis.

**Impact:** Hands-on understanding of large retail networks, constraints, and data-driven optimisation problems.

---

### Coop / Food Discount Operations – Hungary  
**Logistics, warehouse and personnel management**

- Managed daily store supply-chain operations, including stock control, routing, and replenishment.  
- Coordinated warehouse operations, procurement logistics and staff scheduling.  

**Impact:** Ground-level operational discipline and real-world constraint handling.

---

### Earlier Roles (Contextual)

- **DVG – Deutsche Vertriebsgesellschaft für Filme und Publikationen**:  
  Worked in a distribution environment for governmental, educational and OECD materials, just before the large-scale Eastern European opening.

- **Retail and tourism roles (Hungary)**:  
  Clothing retail in Kecskemét and housing/tourism logistics around Lake Balaton – early practical exposure to customer behaviour, seasonality, and operational flexibility.

## Academic Background

### Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen–Nürnberg  
**Diplom-Kaufmann (Univ.)**

Specialisations:

- **Business Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik)** – under the Mertens/Amberg school  
- **Logistics & Supply Chain** – under Prof. Klaus and Feige  
- **Strategic Management** – under Prof. Harald Hungenberg  
- **Marketing Empirics** – SPSS-based empirical research, survey methods, data interpretation  
- **Business Engineering & Software Evolution** – understanding how enterprise IT systems evolve  
- **RFID & barcode-based inventory systems** in industrial workflows

### Hungary – Commercial / Trade Studies

- Higher education in Commerce, Hospitality and Tourism.  
- Early research on **PC market evolution** in Hungary (1996–2000) and the role of logistics and distribution in emerging digital markets.

## Thesis Work & Empirical Methods

### Diplomarbeit (Grade: 1.7 – “gut”)  
**Title:** *“Akzeptanz von Open Source Software: Eine empirische Untersuchung der Akzeptanz auf dem Arbeitsplatzrechner”*  
**Publisher:** VDM Verlag, ISBN 978-3639000818

Core elements:

- Full SPSS empirical workflow (data cleaning, reliability, factor analysis, regression, significance testing).  
- Application of **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** and **Diffusion of Innovations (DOI)** frameworks.  
- Focus on workplace computing, user resistance, trust, and organisational dynamics.  
- Combined behavioural, psychological and technical perspectives on software adoption – effectively “UX research before formal UX”.

### Hungarian Thesis – RFID & Barcode

- Thesis on **barcode- and RFID-based inventory systems** at the Trilak-Haering paint manufacturing company.  
- Analysed production, storage and distribution flows within a chemical-industry context.

---

## Early Computing & Technical Origin

- Received my first 8-bit computer in 6th grade while living behind the Iron Curtain.  
- Learned programming logic, hardware behaviour and system design under strict resource constraints.  
- Belonged to a generation where several peers later joined major game studios (PlayStation VR, Total War, Japanese/UK-based developments).  
- This environment formed a deep intuition for optimisation, system coherence, and how users really interact with software.

---

## Enterprise System Architecture (Summary)

- **SAP-based production and waste-flow logistics architecture** (Odenwald-Früchte)  
- **Access-based full-stack operational system** for Dräger’s North American demo equipment

## Relevance for xAI – Lead Grok Engineer

- I have repeatedly taken ambiguous, high-stakes operational problems and turned them into coherent, functioning systems.  
- I understand software acceptance, human factors and system failures – essential for building AI that people actually use.  
- My empirical training enables me to design, run and interpret evaluations and benchmarks.  
- My logistics and systems background translates naturally into designing LLM-powered tools with clear, real-world impact.
